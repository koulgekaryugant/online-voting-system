# online-voting-system
Here is the step-by-step guide to set up and run the online voting system project:

**Step 1: Download the Project**

Download the online voting system project from a reliable source, such as GitHub or a file-sharing platform.

**Step 2: Extract the Files**

Extract the downloaded zip file to a folder on your computer. This will create a new folder with all the project files.

**Step 3: Install XAMPP**

Download and install XAMPP (Cross-platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP) on your computer from the official Apache Friends website: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

**Step 4: Set up XAMPP**

After installation, launch XAMPP and follow these steps:

* Start the Apache and MySQL services by clicking on the start buttons.
* Configure the database settings by editing the `phpMyAdmin` settings (default username: root, password: blank).

**Step 5: Import Database**

Open `phpMyAdmin` (http://localhost/phpmyadmin/) and create a new database for the project. Then, import the `online-voting-system.sql` file into the newly created database.

**Step 6: Access the Project**

Open a web browser and type the following URL to access the online voting system:
```
http://localhost/online-voting-system/
```
You should see the login page of the online voting system.

**Tips and Requirements**

* Make sure you have PHP 7.2 or later installed.
* Ensure that your MySQL version is compatible with PHP.
* The project requires a MySQL database to store voter information, candidates, and voting results.
* You may need to adjust the database connection settings in the `config.php` file if your database details are different.
* This is a basic online voting system and does not include advanced features like user authentication, encryption, or security measures. You may need to add these features to make it more secure and professional.

I hope this helps! If you encounter any issues during setup or running the project, feel free to ask.
